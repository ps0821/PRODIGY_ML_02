# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) on Kaggle.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is crucial for retail businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for customer segmentation. This project aims to cluster customers based on their purchase behavior using K-means clustering.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including their age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to segment customers into different groups based on their similarities in these features.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

<h1><b>Usage</b></h1>

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

cd customer-segmentation

**Run the customer_segmentation.py script to perform customer segmentation:**

python customer_segmentation.py

<h1><b>Model</b></h1>

The K-means clustering algorithm is implemented using the scikit-learn library. The key steps involved are:

**Data Preprocessing:** Scaling the features to have zero mean and unit variance.

**Model Training:** Training a K-means clustering model on the customer dataset.

**Cluster Visualization:** Visualizing the clusters to understand customer segmentation.

<h1><b>Results</b></h1>

The results of customer segmentation are visualized using scatter plots and other relevant visualizations. The effectiveness of the segmentation is evaluated based on the distribution of customers across different clusters.
